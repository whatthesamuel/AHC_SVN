# AHC_SVN
SVN commit tracker for my current main game: Actions have consequences    
    
**Since I use SVN for my current main project "Actions Have Consequences", I thought it would be nice to make this repository to keep track of my progress on github.**    
changes.txt will be updated whenever make changes to my local SVN server.    
The process is automated and the details are explained on my website: [https://whatthesamuel.com/projects/networking/svn-githow-to-link-svn-commits-to-github/](https://whatthesamuel.com/projects/networking/svn-githow-to-link-svn-commits-to-github/)
