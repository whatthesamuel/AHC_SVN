# Update tracker for "Actions Have Consequences"
This is the update tracker for my current main project: Actions have consequences    
    
**Since I use SVN for my current main project "Actions Have Consequences", I thought it would be nice to make this repository to keep track and share my progress on github.**    
    
How it works: Whenever changes are made to my self-hosted SVN server, it will be logged in the changes.txt in this repository.
