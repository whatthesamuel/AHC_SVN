SVN commit tracker for Actions have consequences

**Since I use SVN for my current main project "Actions Have Consequences", I thought it would be nice to make this repository to keep track of my progress on github.**
The process is automated and the details are explained on my website: [https://whatthesamuel.com](https://whatthesamuel.com)
